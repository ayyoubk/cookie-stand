***This project is to help Pat with his new brand called Salmon Cookies, by working on internal data management for his brand. This project is the first attempt to create an adaptable application that can remove locations from the daily projections report for example.***

    1. Uses JavaScript Object to Stores the min/max hourly customers, and the average cookies per customer, in object properties.
    2. Uses a method of that object to generate a random number of customers per hour, Then calculate and store the simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour at each location.
    3. Store the results for each location in a separate array.
    4. Calculating the sum of these hourly totals, then display the values of each array as unordered lists.
    5. write some JavaScript and CSS lines and this work took like 3 hours.

    1. Replace all of your object literals for the salmon cookie stand with a single constructor function.
    2. Replace the lists of your data for each store and build a single table of data
    3. work on design aspects of the public-facing page. And this work took like 2 hours.
