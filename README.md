    1. Uses JavaScript Object to Stores the min/max hourly customers, and the average cookies per customer, in object properties.
    2. Uses a method of that object to generate a random number of customers per hour, Then calculate and store the simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour at each location.
    3. Store the results for each location in a separate array.
    4. Calculating the sum of these hourly totals, then display the values of each array as unordered lists.
    5. write some JavaScript and CSS lines and this work took like 3 hours.
